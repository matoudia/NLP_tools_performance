The data we work on is in the form of a perfectly structured RDF graph and semanticized according to the DOREMUS musical model.
DOREMUS, a project involving research on the semantic web, aims to develop tools and methods to publish, share, connect, enrich catalogs of works and musical events in the web of data. Its overall objective is to facilitate access to data and musical knowledge via the construction of a common knowledge model (an ontology).
With the aim of creating a relationship of equivalence between works coming from two institutions different, several approaches and methods have been put in place. 
Naturally the first approach is to compare them directly since they have been represented according to the same model. That is to say, on the one hand, comparing the classes, which are resources or raw data, with each other and on the other hand the properties or predicates.
